This project is an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that implements a calculator with SafeMath and Ownable features. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) while ensuring safe handling of integers and restricting access to only the contract owner.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install
Deployment

Before deploying the contract to a testnet, I need to set up my API key. Create an Infura  account and generate an API key which is 13a72f10f9d140a6a2c607f48c90a36b. 
Then Deployed the Contract

Before deploying the contract to a testnet, I need to set up my API key. Create an Infura or Alchemy account and generate an API key. I eplaced 13a72f10f9d140a6a2c607f48c90a36b as my API Key in the hardhat.config.js file with my actual API key.
